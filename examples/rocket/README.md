# itconfig rocket example


### Installation

To install a nightly version of Rust, we recommend using rustup. Install rustup by following the instructions on its website. Once rustup is installed, configure Rust nightly as your default toolchain by running the command:

`rustup default nightly`

If you prefer, once we setup a project directory in the following section, you can use per-directory overrides to use the nightly version only for your Rocket project by running the following command in the directory:

`rustup override set nightly`



### Usage

```bash
cd examples/rocket

cargo run
```
